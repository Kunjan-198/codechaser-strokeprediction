# codechaser-strokeprediction
it predict stroke (healthcare)

nowdays stroke is very dangarous disease in world and for that we make a stroke predictor which will predict according to dataset . and it is user friendly
because it was connecting machine learning model through flask so who can't understand machine learning they will also can use this site easily.

main idea is that how to fit via flask our model 
and also its accuracy is around 95 percentage 
so it will help without  checkup...........


steps to make project run

 downolad html file
 
 make machine learning model using pycharm
 
 after it load model of machinelearning to .pkl file using pickle
 
 and then connect html and model using flask
